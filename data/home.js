Not since the days of Flash has something ever so horrendous been brought to the public light. \n \n\
I thus present to you the culmination of my triumphs and struggles: JS Pages, Mark II. \n \n\
This will be filled with examples of what NOT to do in programming as I tell you all about things that worked... and mostly things that didn't work. \n \n\
In time, I promise to update this contraption into something more user friendly. One hopes."
